# FIWARE Step-by-Step

[![Documentation](https://nexus.lab.fiware.org/repository/raw/public/badges/chapters/documentation.svg)](https://fiware-tutorials.rtfd.io)
[![Support badge](https://nexus.lab.fiware.org/repository/raw/public/badges/stackoverflow/fiware.svg)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fiware)

This is a collection of tutorials for the FIWARE system. Each tutorial consists
of a series of exercises to demonstrate the correct use of individual FIWARE
components and shows the flow of context data within a simple Smart Solution
either by connecting to a series of dummy IoT devices or manipulating the
context directly or programmatically.

<h3>How to Use</h3>

Each tutorial is a self contained learning exercise designed to teach the
developer about a single aspect of FIWARE. A summary of the goal of the tutorial
can be found in the description at the head of each page. Every tutorial is
associated with a GitHub repository holding the configuration files needed to
run the examples. Most of the tutorials build upon concepts or enablers
described in previous exercises to create a complex smart solution which is
_"powered by FIWARE"_.

The tutorials are split according to the chapters defined within the
[FIWARE catalog](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/) and are numbered
in the order of difficulty within each chapter hence an introduction to a given
enabler will occur before the full capabilities of that element are explored in
more depth.

It is recommended to start with reading the full **Core Context Management:
Fundamentals** Chapter before moving on to other subjects, as this will give you
a fuller understanding of the role of context data in general. However it is
not necessary to follow all the subsequent tutorials sequentially - as FIWARE is
a modular system, you can choose which enablers are of interest to you.

## Prerequisites

### Docker and Docker Compose

To keep things simple, all components will be running inside a seperate
[Docker](https://www.docker.com). **Docker** is a container technology which
allows to different components be isolated into their respective environments.

-   To install Docker on Windows follow the instructions
    [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
-   To install Docker on Mac follow the instructions
    [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
-   To install Docker on Linux follow the instructions
    [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications. A series of `*.yaml` files are used to configure the required
services for the application. This means all container services can be brought
up in a single command. Docker Compose is installed by default as part of Docker
for Windows and Docker for Mac, however Linux users will need to follow the
instructions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

You can check your current **Docker** and **Docker Compose** versions using the
following commands:

```bash
docker-compose -v
docker version
```

Please ensure that you are using Docker version 18.03 or higher and Docker
Compose 1.21 or higher and upgrade if necessary.

### Cygwin for Windows

We will start up our services using a simple Bash script. Windows users should
download [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) to provide a command-line
functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.

## List of Tutorials

<h3>Core Context Managment: Fundamentals</h3>

These first tutorials are an introduction to the FIWARE Context Broker, and are
an essential first step when learning to use FIWARE

&nbsp; 101. [Getting Started](getting-started.md)<br/> &nbsp; 102.
[Entity Relationships](entity-relationships.md)<br/> &nbsp; 103.
[CRUD Operations](crud-operations.md)<br/> &nbsp; 104.

[Altering the Context Programmatically](accessing-context.md)<br/> &nbsp; 106.
[Subscribing to Changes in Context](subscriptions.md)<br/>

<h3>Internet of Things, Robots and third-party systems</h3>

In order to make a context-based system aware of the state of the real world, it
will need to access information from Robots, IoT Sensors or other suppliers of
context data such as social media. It is also possible to generate commands from
the context broker to alter the state of real-world objects themselves.
